## Unit 2 | Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street


### Background

Depending on your comfort level with VBA, choose  from Easy, Moderate, or Hard levels below.

### Easy

Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

### Moderate

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.
- Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
- The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
- The total Volume of the stock
- Ticker symbol

You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Hard

Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.
Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

### CHALLENGE

Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
This can be applied to any of the difficulties.
